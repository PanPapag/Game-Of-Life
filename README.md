# Game-Of-Life (under construction)

### Nikos' notes:

So far, I have done:
 - Main to check args (TODO: possibly wrong numbering)
 - Read grid from file (instructions @ common_functions.c)
 - Randomize grid to begin with
 - Implemented rules of GoL
 - Added a small grid just to check everything is ok (under misc/grids/)


Assummptions:
 - Grid is char** : '0' is dead, '1' is alive
 -
